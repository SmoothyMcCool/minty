	<h1>Creating and Editing</h1>

	<p>
		Workflows are composed of individual <strong>tasks</strong> that perform specific actions, plus one
		special <strong>output task</strong> that runs once all other tasks have finished. The typical workflow
		begins with a <code>PacketEmitter</code> that carries the state needed to drive the rest of the
		pipeline, such as a query ID or other contextual data.
	</p>

	<ul class="list-group mb-4">
		<li class="list-group-item"><strong>Tasks</strong> - The building blocks of a workflow. Connect them in the
			order that matches the business logic you need to implement.</li>
		<li class="list-group-item"><strong>PacketEmitter</strong> - The first task in most workflows. It emits a packet
			that contains the state information required by subsequent tasks.</li>
		<li class="list-group-item"><strong>Per-packet results</strong> - Some tasks keep a copy of the data they
			processed for later use. Refer to the individual task documentation for details on how to store, retrieve,
			or manipulate these results.</li>
		<li class="list-group-item"><strong>Array handling</strong> - Most tasks can operate on arrays of text or data.
			However, it is usually simpler to design the workflow so that each piece of information lives in its own
			packet. This avoids the need to split, normalize, duplicate, or combine arrays. The Task documentation
			provides guidance on how to perform these operations if you do need to work with arrays.</li>
	</ul>

	<h1 class="mb-3">Output Tasks</h1>

	<p class="mb-4">
		Output tasks are special because they execute only once, after all other tasks have completed. They receive an
		<strong>ExecutionResult</strong> object that contains metadata and aggregated results from the entire workflow.
	</p>

	<ul class="list-group mb-4">
		<li class="list-group-item"><strong>startTime</strong> - Timestamp when the workflow started.</li>
		<li class="list-group-item"><strong>endTime</strong> - Timestamp when the workflow finished.</li>
		<li class="list-group-item"><strong>logFile</strong> - Path or URL to the log file generated during execution.
		</li>
		<li class="list-group-item"><strong>results</strong> - A map keyed by step names (not task names). Each key maps
			to a list of JSON objects, one for every packet processed by that step. Example usage: assembling HTML
			fragments from multiple <code>HTML Formatter</code> tasks.</li>
		<li class="list-group-item"><strong>errors</strong> - Structured like <code>results</code>. Contains a list of
			error strings emitted by different tasks, if any.</li>
	</ul>
